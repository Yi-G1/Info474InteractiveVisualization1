        <h1>HW 2 </h1>
        <p className = "Intro">
        <br/>
Gender equality is a topic that have been constantly discussed in our daily life.
        In the workforce, many people are still debating whether or not there are bias towards one side or another, and how significant is this bias.
There are many standards people use to measure bias, such as average age, average income, population, etc. Arguably, each one of these standards only show one aspect of the real life, and some of them may not be as meaningful.
        For example, one such standard would be showing the paycheck of women on average compare to men.
        There are people arguing that women in general are paid less than men,  but others counter this argument by stating that most very low Value jobs are mostly male workers than female.
        <br/><br/>
        For the scope of this project (which would be continued after HW2 by my self), we will look at several standards **(hw2 only look at wage gap)**, breifly examine them, and come up with a conclusion on our own.
        More specifically, we will study the following question:
        <br/><br/>
        1. Are there bias in XXX (a given standard) around the world/In the US?
          If there are, is it getting better or worse overtime?
          <br/><br/>
        2. Are data obtained from the datasets accurate? Will using different datasets come up with different conclusion? Does it fit what people believe and spread online?
        <br/><br/>
        3. How does education influence gender equality with in different countries? Does more educated means less bias?
        <br/>         <br/>

         </p>
         <br/>

         <p>Firstly, let us study a dataset contains information around the world. Note that the gender wage gap data is obtained from the data source and will be verified by other datasets in later homeworks or by my own investigation.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>1. We first study geographically what bias look like around the world in the year 2018.</p>
          <WorldMap/>

          <p>From this graph, it is clear to us that this dataset is only focused in the N.A. and E.U. regions. Countries such as South Africa, China, India, were not included.</p>
          <p>Thus, when we comeup with a conclusion from evaluate the data in the latter part, we should take the conclusion with a grain of salt.</p>

         <p>2. We will look at the same data from a different perspective. </p>
         <table>
                 <thead>
                   <tr>
                     <th width="20%">Country</th>
                     <th width="20%"> Wage Gap (Male>Female)</th>
                     <th></th>

                 <tbody>
                   {world2018datamid.map(d => (
                     <tr key={d.Country}>

                       <td>
                         {d.Value}
                       </td>
                       <td>
                         <svg height="50">
                           <rect width={widthScale(d.Value)} height="50" fill={'pink'} />
                         </svg>

                       </td>
                     </tr>

        <p>This shows us that Costa Rica	have the least wage-gap difference whereas Korea has most wage-gap difference.</p>
        <p>3. Let us take a deeper look into the US--change of gender gap for top 10, bottom 10 and median  over time. </p>
        <Legend
          data={legendData}
          selectedItems={selectedItems}
          onChange={onChangeSelection}
        />
        <MultilineChart data={chartData} dimensions={dimensions} />
        <p>80% of the gender gap in the US lie in between the white line and the purple line. <br/>The gender gap problem in the US did reduce in general.(Also considering the inflation problem) <br/> </p>

        <p>4. The average gender wage difference by countries.  </p>
        <Graph4/>
        <p>Thoughout all years, the country with most extreme wage gap is Korea, and interestingly, no country is having negative gaps.</p>
        <p>5.The average gender wage difference by year -- have we get better each year?</p>
        <Graph5/>
        <p>Our world has less gender gap on average compare to a decade ago. But not much progress have been made in general in the last 5 years.</p>

        <p>6. In 2002, the percentage of countries bias towards women/man.</p>
        <Graph6/>
        <p>Of 19 countries where data is collected, 19 of them have positive wage gap.</p>

        <p>7. In 2018, the percentage of countries bias towards women/man.</p>
        <Graph7/>
        <p>Of 31 countries where data is collected, 29 of them have positive wage gap. <br/>It is wonderful to see this difference.</p>

        <p>8. In 2019, the percentage of countries bias towards women/man.</p>
        <Graph8/>
        <p>Unfortunatelyï¼Œof 12 countries where data is collected, all of them have positive wage gap. <br/>
        This is an excellent example to that the pattern obtained from the dataset could be unreliable/inconclusive due to data vairation and sampling sizes.</p>
